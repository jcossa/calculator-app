## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am just a beginner in web development, and i just decide, to have a crack of this intermediary level challenge.

In this challenge i learnt what CSS grid is, 'cause i have never used it before, it was my first time.
And i'm glad it went well, it went smoothly. 

```
.keypad{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    gap: 20px;
}
```
The pitful of CSS Grid design is that it did not work i some browsers.
I don't know why,  but i want to know more, but i guess it was the version of the broswer, it was pretty old.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

what i want to learn is compatibility with another browsers. I want to know how to use a design pattern that will work in many browsers possible and that are in use, or the most common browser.
That my next learn curve. It's an awesome adventure. Really cool.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid) - Oh boy, this was a very excellent tutorial. I really love it. I learnt CSS Grid through it.
